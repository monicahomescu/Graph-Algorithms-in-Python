# Graph-Algorithms-in-Python

2.

Write a program that finds the connected components of an undirected graph using a breadth-first traversal of the graph.

3.

Write a program that, given a graph with costs that has no negative cost cycles and two vertices, finds a lowest cost walk between the given vertices. The program shall use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

4.

Write a program that, given a graph with costs, does the following:

verify if the corresponding graph is a DAG and performs a topological sorting of the activities using the algorithm based on predecessor counters;
if it is a DAG, finds a highest cost path between two given vertices, in O(m+n).

5.

Given an undirected graph, find a vertex cover covering of edges by vertices with no more than twice the optimal number of vertices in O(n+m) time.
